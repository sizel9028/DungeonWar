# DungeonWar
I made DungeonWar.apk mobile game with Unity.
Game explain ::
Dungeon Wars is a line defense game where you gather resources to upgrade units, destroy the hearts that summon monsters in the dungeon, and ultimately aim to monsters all the hearts within the dungeon. Fight and triumph against increasingly powerful monsters as you descend deeper underground!
You can get my game in google play store after my private test.

Google private test period 3/22 - 4/05
The Google closed beta test may not end on the scheduled date. 
However, what’s certain is that it will be released on Google after 4/05.

i cant upload all of my file in Unity, because there are some of assets in my game.
So, I will upload all of code in my Unity game.

Compared to the initial plan, the game’s flow has changed significantly, making the code messier than expected.
